<h2>DOCUMENTARY HISTORY OF THE RIO GRANDE<br />
PUEBLOS OF NEW MEXICO</h2>

<h3>BY ADOLPH F. BANDELIER</h3>

<h3>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bibliographic Introduction</span></h3>

<p>Seventeen years have elapsed since I was in the territory in
which the events in the early history of the Rio Grande
Pueblos transpired, and twenty-nine years since I first entered
the field of research among those Pueblos under the auspices of the
Arch&aelig;ological Institute of America. I am now called upon by the
Institute to do for the Indians of the Rio Grande villages what I
did nearly two decades ago for the Zu&ntilde;i tribe, namely, to record
their documentary history.</p>

<p>I shall follow the method employed by me in the case of the
documentary history of Zu&ntilde;i, by giving the events with strict adherence
to documentary sources, so far as may be possible, and shall
employ the correlated information of other branches only when
absolutely indispensable to the elucidation of the documentary
material.</p>

<p>The geographical features of the region to be treated are too
well known to require mention. Neither can folklore and tradition,
notwithstanding their decisive importance in a great many cases, be
touched upon except when alluded to in the sources themselves. I
am fully aware, as I stated in presenting the history of the Zu&ntilde;i
tribe, that a history based exclusively on documents, whether printed
or written, must necessarily be imperfect because it is not impartial,
since it summarizes the views of those who saw and understood but
one side of the question, and judged it only from their own standpoint.
This defect cannot be remedied, as it underlies the very
nature of the task, and the greater therefore is the necessity of
carefully studying the folklore of the Indians in order to check and
complete as well as to correct the picture presented by people acquainted
with the art of writing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">p. 2</a></span></p>

<p>In this Introduction I forego the employment of quotations,
reserving such for the main work. Quotations and footnotes are
not, as it has been imagined, a mere display of erudition&mdash;they
are a duty towards the source from which they are taken, and a duty
to its author; moreover, they are a duty towards the reader, who
as far as possible should be placed in a position himself to judge
the value and nature of the information presented, and, finally, they
are a necessary indication of the extent of the author's responsibility.
If the sources are given clearly and circumstantially, yet
happen to be wrong, the author is exonerated from blame for resting
upon their authority, provided, as it not infrequently happens, he
has no way of correcting them by means of other information.</p>

<p>In entering the field of documentary research the first task is to
become thoroughly acquainted with the languages in which the documents
are recorded. To be able to read cursorily a language in
its present form is not sufficient. Spanish, for example, has changed
comparatively less than German since the sixteenth century, yet
there are locutions as well as words found in early documents pertaining
to America that have fallen into disuse and hence are not
commonly understood. Provincialisms abound, hence the history
of the author and the environment in which he was reared should
be taken into account, for sometimes there are phrases that are
unintelligible without a knowledge of the writer's early surroundings.
Translations as a rule should be consulted only with allowance, for
to the best of them the Italian saying "Traduttore, tradittore" is
applicable. With the greatest sincerity and honesty on the part of
the translator, he is liable to an imperfect interpretation of an original
text. There are of course instances when the original has disappeared
and translations alone are available. Such is the case, for
instance, with the Life of Columbus, written by his son Fernando
and published in Italian in 1571; and the highly important report
on the voyage of Cabral to Brazil in 1500, written by his pilot Vas
da Cominho and others. These are known only through translations.</p>

<p>Words from Indian languages are subject to very faulty rendering
in the older documents. In the first place, sound alone guided
the writers, and Indian pronunciation is frequently indistinct in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">p. 3</a></span>
vowels and variable according to the individual&mdash;hence the frequent
interchange in the Spanish sources of <i>a</i> and <i>o</i>, <i>&oacute;</i> and <i>u</i>, <i>e</i> and <i>i</i>. For
many sounds even the alphabets of civilized speech have not adequate
phonetic signs. I may refer, as an example, to the Indian name in
the Tigua language for the pueblo of Sandia. The Spanish attempt
to render it by the word "Napeya" is utterly inadequate, and even
by means of the complicated alphabets for writing Indian tongues I
would not attempt to record the native term. In endeavoring to
identify localities from names given to them in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries by European authors, this difficulty should always
be taken into account. No blame can be attached to the writers for
such defects; it should always be remembered that they did not
know, still less understand, the idioms they heard. Still less should
we be surprised if the same site is sometimes mentioned under
various names. Every Pueblo language has its own geographical
vocabulary, and when, as sometimes happened, several tribes met
in council with the whites, the latter heard and unwittingly recorded
several names for one and the same locality, thus apparently increasing
the number of villages. Moreover, interpreters were not always
at hand, and when they could be had both their competency and
their sincerity were open to question.</p>

<p>It is not unusual to read in modern works that such and such
a source is the reliable one <i>par excellence</i>, and the principal basis
upon which to establish conclusions. No source, however seemingly
insignificant, should be neglected. A brief mention is sometimes
very important, as it may be a clue to new data, or may
confirm or refute accepted information and thus lead to further
investigation. Some documents, of course, are much more explicit
than others, but this is no reason why the latter should be neglected.
The value of a source may be subject to investigation from a number
of points of view, but it is not always possible to obtain the requisite
information. Thus the biographies of authors are an important
requisite, but how seldom are they obtainable with the necessary
detail!</p>

<p>The sources of the history of the Rio Grande Pueblos, both
printed and in manuscript, are numerous. The manuscript documents
are as yet but imperfectly known. Only that which remained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">p. 4</a></span>
at Santa F&eacute; after the first period of Anglo-American occupancy&mdash;a
number of church books and documents formerly scattered
through the parishes of New Mexico, and a very few documents held
in private hands&mdash;have been accessible within the United States.
In Mexico the parish and other official documents at El Paso del
Norte (Juarez) up to the beginning of the eighteenth century have
been examined by me to a certain extent, and at the City of Mexico
the Archivo Nacional has yielded a number of important papers,
though the research has been far from exhaustive, owing to the lack of
time and support. Hence much still remains to be done in that
field. Some destruction of papers of an official character appears
to have taken place at Mexico also, yet with the present condition
of the archives there is hope that much that appears to be lost will
eventually be brought to light; in any event we still have recourse
to the Spanish archives, principally at Sevilla. It was the rule
during Spanish colonial domination to have every document of any
importance executed in triplicate, one copy to remain at the seat of
local government, another to be sent to the viceregal archives, and
the third to the mother country. Hence there is always a hope that, if
the first two were destroyed, the third might be preserved. So, for
instance, the collection of royal decrees (<i>cedulas</i>) is imperfect at the
City of Mexico. There are lacun&aelig; of several decades, and it is
perhaps significant that the same gaps are repeated in the publication
of the "Cedulas" by Aguiar and Montemayor. In regard to
ecclesiastical documents the difficulty is greater still. The archives
of the Franciscan Order, to which the missions on the Rio Grande
were assigned almost until the middle of the nineteenth century, have
become scattered; the destruction of the archives at the great Franciscan
convent in the City of Mexico in 1857, though not complete,
resulted in the dispersion of those which were not burned or torn,
and the whereabouts of these remnants are but imperfectly known.
The documentary history of the Rio Grande Pueblos, therefore, can
be only tentative at present, but it is given in the hope that it will
incite further activity with the view of increasing and correcting the
data thus far obtained.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The report of Cabeza de Vaca, commonly designated as his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">p. 5</a></span>
"Naufragios," is as yet the earliest printed source known with
reference to the Rio Grande Pueblos, concerning whom it imparts
some vague information. The briefness and vagueness of that
information calls for no adverse criticism, for Cabeza de Vaca
plainly states that he writes of these people from hearsay and that
his information was obtained near the mouth of the Rio Pecos in
western Texas. What he afterward learned in Sonora with respect
to sedentary Indians in the north is hardly connected with the Rio
Grande region. The same may be the case with the information
obtained by Nu&ntilde;o de Guzman in 1530 and alluded to by Casta&ntilde;eda.
That Nu&ntilde;o de Guzman had gained some information concerning
the Pueblos seems certain, but everything points to the Zu&ntilde;i region
as the one mentioned by his informant. The same is true of the
reports of Fray Marcos de Nizza and Melchor Diaz, which clearly
apply to the Zu&ntilde;i Pueblos, the most easterly settlement of sedentary
Indians alluded to being the Queres pueblo of Acoma. It is to the
chroniclers of the expedition of Coronado, therefore, that we must
look for the earliest definite information concerning the Rio Grande
valley and its inhabitants.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that the expedition of Coronado was
not a mere exploration. What was expected of its leader, and
indeed peremptorily demanded, was a permanent settlement of the
country. Coronado and his men were not to return to Mexico
except in individual cases. The Viceroy Mendoza wanted to get
rid of them. Whether Coronado was a party to the secret of this
plan is doubtful; the indications are that he was not, whereas Fray
Marcos of Nizza certainly was, and perhaps was its original
promoter.</p>

<p>The printed sources on Coronado's march may be divided into
two chronologically distinct classes, the first of which comprises
documents written in New Mexico in the years from 1540 to 1543;
these reflect all the advantages and disadvantages of the writings
of eye-witnesses. The mere fact that one had been a participant in
the events which he describes is not a guaranty of absolute reliability:
his sincerity and truthfulness may be above reproach, but
his field of vision is necessarily limited, and the personal element
controls his impressions, even against his will, hence his state<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">p. 6</a></span>ments.
These earliest sources regarding Coronado consist of the
letters of Coronado himself (with the related letter of Viceroy
Mendoza), and several briefer documents written in New Mexico
but without indication of their authors. The last two letters written
by Coronado alone touch upon the Rio Grande Pueblos&mdash;those of
August 3, 1540, and October 20, 1541.</p>

<p>As stated above, the expedition of Coronado was not designed
as a mere exploration, but rather for the purpose of establishing a
permanent settlement. Coronado's second letter, the first in which
he touches upon the Rio Grande Pueblos, appears to have been lost.
His letter of October 20, 1541, although written near the site of the
present Bernalillo, New Mexico, contains very little in regard to the
Rio Grande Pueblos.</p>

<p>The briefer documents pertaining to Coronado's expedition, and
written while the Spaniards were still in New Mexico, with the exception
of one (the report of the reconnoissance made by Hernando
de Alvarado, accompanied by Fray Juan de Padilla to the east)
concern Zu&ntilde;i almost exclusively. The document respecting
Alvarado's journey is contained in the <i>Coleccion de Documentos</i>
from the archives of the Indies, but is erroneously attributed to
Hernando de Soto. The celebrated historiographer of Spain, Juan
Bautista Mu&ntilde;oz, unacquainted with New Mexico, its geography and
ethnography, criticized it rather harshly; nevertheless, the document
is very reliable in its description of country and people: it alludes
to features which are nowhere else noticed, and which were
rediscovered by the late Frank Hamilton Cushing and myself about
twenty-eight years ago. The number of villages and people in the
Rio Grande region, of which the document gives a brief description,
are, as usual, exaggerated; and it could hardly have been otherwise
in view of a first and hasty visit, but it remains the earliest document
in which Acoma and a part of the Rio Grande valley are
treated from actual observation. The reconnoissance was made from
August to October, 1540. It may be that one of the villages
briefly described is Pecos, which lies of course some distance east of
the Rio Grande, and the document is possibly the first one in which
the nomadic Indians of eastern New Mexico are mentioned from
actual observation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">p. 7</a></span></p>

<p>To these sources, which have both the merits and the defects of all
documents written under the impressions of first direct acquaintance
with the subject, must be added the "Relacion postrera de Sivola"
contained in a manuscript by father Toribio de Paredes, surnamed
Motolinia, and known as the <i>Libro de Oro</i>, etc., which is an augmented
and slightly modified version of that celebrated missionary's
history of the Mexicans. It is a condensed report that had reached
Mexico after Coronado had left for Quivira and before his return
had become known. Its allusion to the Rio Grande Pueblos and to
Pecos is not without value, although it adds little to what is contained
in the sources previously mentioned. On the Indians of the
Plains it is, comparatively speaking, more explicit. The general
tone of the document is one of sobriety. The "Relacion del Suceso,"
published in the <i>Documentos In&eacute;ditos de Indias</i> under the erroneous
date of 1531, is similar to the foregoing, but is more detailed in some
respects and covers a longer period of time. It manifestly was
written in New Mexico by a member of the expedition, but there is
no clue as yet to the name of the author. It is a useful corollary
to the other contemporary sources.</p>

<p>Although written more than two centuries after Coronado's
march, the references to it and to New Mexico contained in the
<i>Historia de la Nueva Galicia</i>, by the licentiate Matias de la Mota
Padilla, find a place here, since the author asserts that he derived
much of his information from papers left by Pedro de Tovar, one of
Coronado's chief lieutenants. Mota Padilla generally confirms the
data furnished by the earlier documents, and adds some additional
information. It is however quite impossible to determine what he
gathered directly from the writings of Tovar and what he may have
obtained through other and probably posterior sources. At all
events the <i>Historia de la Nueva Galicia</i> should never be neglected
by students of the Pueblo Indians.</p>

<p>We now come to the two chief chroniclers of Coronado's time&mdash;both
participants in his undertakings and therefore eye-witnesses:
Pedro de Casta&ntilde;eda de Naxera and Juan Jaramillo. The fact that
they were eye-witnesses establishes their high rank as authorities,
but there is a difference between the two in that Casta&ntilde;eda was a
common soldier, whereas Jaramillo (a former companion and, to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">p. 8</a></span>
certain extent, a friend of Cort&eacute;s) was an officer. This fact alone
establishes a difference in the opportunities for knowing and in the
standpoint of judging what was seen, aside from the difference
arising out of the character, facilities, and tendencies of the two
individuals. Casta&ntilde;eda is much more detailed in his narration
than Jaramillo. Discontent with the management and the final
outcome of the enterprise is apparent in the tone of his writings, and
while this may not have influenced very materially his description
of the country and its people, they render more or less suspicious
his statements in regard to the dealings with the aborigines. Both
Casta&ntilde;eda and Jaramillo wrote a long time after the events had
occurred, and probably from memory, hence the comparative accuracy
of their descriptions is indeed remarkable. But that accuracy,
however commendable, is relative rather than absolute, as both
were liable to err, owing to the lapse of time and consequent failure
to remember facts and events, and, especially with Casta&ntilde;eda, the
influence of personal prejudice growing stronger with age. Jaramillo
had less occasion to fall into error resulting from such weakness,
but he is much less detailed than Casta&ntilde;eda. We might
compare the two narrations by stating that that of Jaramillo embodies
the reminiscences of one who stood officially on a higher
plane and viewed his subject from a more general standpoint,
whereas Casta&ntilde;eda saw more of the inferior details but was more
susceptible of confounding, hence to misstate, the mass of data
which his memory retained. Both reports will always remain the
chief sources on the subject of which they treat, subject of course
to close comparison and checking with correlated sources, archaeological,
ethnological, and geographical investigation, and Indian
tradition.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further in the discussion of the documents it
must be stated that all references to distances in leagues must be
taken with many allowances. According to Las Casas there were
in use among the Spaniards in the sixteenth century, two kinds of
leagues: the maritime league (<i>legua maritima</i>) and the terrestrial
league (<i>legua terrestre</i>). The former, established by Alfonso XI in
the twelfth century, consisted of four miles (<i>millas</i>) of four thousand
paces, each pace being equal to three Castilian feet. The length<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">p. 9</a></span>
of the Castilian foot at that time cannot be established with absolute
minuteness. The terrestrial league consisted of three thousand
paces each, so that while it contained nine thousand Castilian feet,
the maritime league was composed of twelve thousand. The latter
was used for distances at sea and occasionally also for distances on
land, therefore where an indication of the league employed is not
positively given, a computation of distances with even approximate
accuracy is of course impossible.</p>

<p>The result of Coronado's failure was so discouraging, and the
reports on the country had been so unfavorable that for nearly forty
years no further attempt was made to reach the North from New
Spain. In fact Coronado and his achievements had become practically
forgotten, and only when the southern part of the present state of
Chihuahua in Mexico became the object of Spanish enterprise for
mining purposes was attention again drawn to New Mexico, when
the Church opened the way thither from the direction of the Atlantic
slope. This naturally led the explorers first to the Rio Grande
Pueblos.</p>

<p>The brief report of the eight companions of Francisco Sanchez
Chamuscado who in 1580 accompanied the Franciscan missionaries
as far as Bernalillo, the site of which was then occupied by Tigua
villages, and who went thence as far as Zu&ntilde;i, is important, although
it presents merely the sketch of a rather hasty reconnoissance. Following,
as the Spaniards did, the course of the Rio Grande from the
south, they fixed, at least approximately, the limit of the Pueblo
region in that direction. Some of the names of Pueblos preserved
in the document are valuable in so far as they inform us of the
designations of villages in a language that was not the idiom of
their inhabitants. Chamuscado having died on the return journey,
the document is not signed by him, but by his men. The document
had been lost sight of until I called attention to it nearly
thirty years ago, the subsequent exploration by Antonio de Espejo
having monopolized the attention of those interested in the early
exploration of New Mexico.</p>

<p>The report of Antonio de Espejo on his long and thorough
reconnoissance in 1582-1583 attracted so much attention that for
a time and in some circles his expedition was looked upon as resulting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">p. 10</a></span>
in the original discovery of New Mexico. This name was also
given by Espejo to the country, and it thereafter remained. While
the documents relating to Coronado slumbered unnoticed and almost
forgotten, the report of Espejo was published within less than three
years after it had been written. It must be stated here that there
are two manuscripts of the report of Espejo, one dated 1583 and
bearing his autograph signature and official (notarial) certificates, the
other in 1584 which is a distorted copy of the original and with so
many errors in names and descriptions that, as the late Woodbury
Lowery very justly observed, it is little else than spurious. I had
already called attention to the unreliability of the latter version, and
yet it is the one that alone was consulted for more than three centuries
because it had become accessible through publication in the
Voiages of Hakluyt, together with an English translation even more
faulty, if possible, than its Spanish original. The authentic document,
with several others relating to Espejo's brief career, was not
published in full until 1871, and even then attracted little attention
because it was not translated and because the <i>Coleccion de Documentos
del Archivo de Indias</i> is not accessible to every one. But the
publication of 1871 was by no means the first printed version of
Espejo's relations. Even prior to 1586 a somewhat condensed narration
of his exploration had been published, being embodied in the
<i>History of China</i> by Father Gonzalez Mendoza. This account is
based on the authentic report in some of the various editions, on the
spurious document in others. The book of Father Mendoza was
soon translated into French. It is not surprising that Espejo's narrative
should appear first in print in a work on the Chinese Empire
by a Franciscan missionary. That ecclesiastic was impressed by
some of Espejo's observations on Pueblo customs which he thought
resembled those of the Chinese. The discoveries of Espejo were
then the most recent ones that had been made by Spaniards, and as
New Mexico was fancied to lie nearer the Pacific than it really does,
and facing the eastern coast of China, a lurking desire to find a
possible connection between the inhabitants of both continents on
that side is readily explicable. But Father Mendoza had still
another motive. The three monks which Chamuscado had left in
New Mexico had sacrificed their lives in an attempt to convert the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">p. 11</a></span>
natives. They were martyrs of their faith, hence glories of their
order, and the Franciscan author could not refrain from commemorating
their deeds and their faith. The spurious text was not
taken from Mendoza, but manifestly was copied from the transcript
by a bungling scribe imperfectly acquainted with the Spanish tongue.</p>

<p>The value of Espejo's narration is undoubtedly great. The
author was a close practical observer and a sincere reporter. The
more is it surprising that his statements in regard to the population
of the Pueblos are so manifestly exaggerated; yet, as I
have elsewhere stated, this may be explained. A tendency to
enhance somewhat the importance of discoveries is inherent in
almost every discoverer, but in the case of Espejo he was exposed
to another danger. As he proceeded from village to village
the natives gathered at every point from other places out of curiosity,
fear, or perhaps with hostile intent, so that the number of the
people which the explorer met was each time much larger than the
actual number of inhabitants. On the question of population Espejo
could have no knowledge, since he had no means of communicating
with the people by speech. Furthermore, it is well known that
a crowd always appears more numerous than it would prove to be
after an actual count; besides, even if he could have counted the
Indians present, he would have fallen into the error of recording the
same individual several times.</p>

<p>During the comparatively short time which Espejo had to explore
the country as far as the Hopi or Moqui, he collected interesting
ethnological data. Customs that appeared new as late as the
second half of the last century were noted by him; and while his
nomenclature of the Pueblos agrees in many points with that of the
Coronado expedition, terms were added that have since been definitely
adopted. Espejo's return to Mexico was to be followed by a definite
occupancy of the Rio Grande country, but his untimely death
prevented it, and the subsequent plan of colonization, framed and
proposed by Juan Bautista de Lomas Colmenares, led to no practical
results, as likewise did the ill-fated expedition of Huma&ntilde;a,
Bonilla, and Leyva, the disastrous end of which in the plains became
known only through a few vestiges of information and by hearsay.</p>

<p>Seven years after Espejo's journey, Gaspar Casta&ntilde;o de Sosa penetrated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">p. 12</a></span>
to the Rio Grande near the present village of Santo Domingo.
The report thereon is explicit and sober, and in it we find the first
mention of the Spanish names by which some of the Pueblos have
since become known. From this report it is easy to follow the
route taken by Casta&ntilde;o and his followers, but the account is incomplete,
terminating abruptly at Santo Domingo, whither Casta&ntilde;o had
been followed by Captain Juan de Morlete, who was sent after him
by the governor of what is now Coahuila, without whose permission
Casta&ntilde;o had undertaken the journey. I have no knowledge as yet
of any document giving an account of the return of the expedition.</p>

<p>Seven years more elapsed ere the permanent occupancy of New
Mexico was effected under the leadership of Juan de O&ntilde;ate.
Thenceforward events in that province became the subject of uninterrupted
documentary record.</p>

<p>The very wise and detailed ordinances regulating the discovery
and annexation to Spain of new territory, promulgated by Philip II,
declared that every exploration or conquest (the term "conquest"
was subsequently eliminated from Spanish official terminology and
that of "pacification" substituted) should be recorded as a journal
or diary. Royal decrees operated very slowly in distant colonies.
Neither Chamuscado nor Espejo kept journals, but Casta&ntilde;o de Sosa,
and especially O&ntilde;ate, did. His <i>diario</i> (which is accessible through its
publication in the <i>Documentos del Archivo de Indias</i>, although there
are traces of an earlier publication) was copied for printing by someone
manifestly unacquainted with New Mexico or with its Indian
nomenclature, hence its numerous names for sites and tribes are
often very difficult to identify. But the document itself is a sober,
matter-of-fact record of occurrences and geographical details, interspersed
with observations of more or less ethnological value. As
O&ntilde;ate followed the course of the Rio Grande upward from below
El Paso del Norte, and afterward branched off to almost every
sedentary settlement in New Mexico and Arizona, the comparison
of his diary with previous reports (those of the Coronado expedition
included) is highly valuable, indeed indispensable. The <i>diario</i>
forms the beginning of accurate knowledge of the region under
consideration. Perhaps more important still are the Acts of Obedience
and Homage (<i>Obediencia y Vasallaje</i>) executed at various villages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">p. 13</a></span>
during the course of the years 1598 and 1599. At first sight, and to
one unacquainted with Pueblo idioms, they present an unintelligible
list of partly recognizable names. But the confusion becomes somewhat
reduced through closer scrutiny and by taking into consideration
the circumstances under which each official document was
framed. O&ntilde;ate already enjoyed the advantage of interpreters in
at least one New Mexican Indian tongue, but the meetings or
councils during which the "acts of obedience" were written were
not always at places where his interpreters understood the language
of the people they were among. These scribes faithfully
recorded the names of pueblos as they heard them, and sometimes
several names, each in a different language for the same village,
hence the number of pueblos recorded is considerably larger than
it actually was. Again the inevitable misunderstanding of Indian
pronunciation by the Spaniards caused them to write the same
word in different forms according as the sounds were uttered and
caught by the ear. An accurate copy of these documents of O&ntilde;ate's
time made by one versed in Pueblo nomenclature and somewhat
acquainted with Pueblo languages would be highly desirable.
O&ntilde;ate is not given to fulness in ethnological details. His journal is
a dry record of what happened during his march and occupancy of
the country. Customs are only incidentally and briefly alluded to.</p>

<p>One of O&ntilde;ate's officers, however, Captain Gaspar Perez de Villagra,
or Villagran, published in 1610 a <i>Historia de la Nueva
Mexico</i> in verse. As an eye-witness of the events he describes, Villagran
has the merits and defects of all such authors, and the fact
that he wrote in rhyme called poetry does not enhance the historical
merit of his book. Nevertheless we find in it many data regarding
the Pueblos not elsewhere recorded, and study of the book is very
necessary. We must allow for the temptation to indulge in so-called
poetical license, although Villagran employs less of it than
most Spanish chroniclers of the period that wrote in verse. The
use of such form and style of writing was regarded in Spain as an
accomplishment at the time, and not many attempted it, which is
just as well. Some of the details and descriptions of actions and
events by Villagran have been impeached as improbable; but even
if such were the case, they would not detract from the merits of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">p. 14</a></span>
book as an attempt at an honest and sincere narration and a reasonably
faithful description.</p>

<p>The minor documents connected with O&ntilde;ate's enterprise and
subsequent administration of the New Mexican colony, so far as
known, are of comparatively small importance to the history of the
Rio Grande Pueblos. During the first years of the seventeenth century
the attention of O&ntilde;ate was directed chiefly toward explorations
in western Arizona and the Gulf of California. While he was absent
on his memorable journey, quarrels arose in New Mexico between
the temporal and ecclesiastical authorities, which disturbed the
colony for many years and form the main theme of the documentary
material still accessible. Even the manuscripts relating to
these troubles contain, here and there, references to the ethnological
condition of the Pueblos. Charges and counter-charges of
abuses committed by church and state could not fail to involve,
incidentally, the points touching upon the Indians, and the documentary
material of that period, still in manuscript but accessible
through the copies made by me and now in the Peabody Museum
of Harvard University, should not be neglected by serious investigators.
To enter into details regarding the tenor of these documents
would be beyond the scope of this Introduction, but I would
call attention in a general way to the value and importance of
church records, which consist chiefly of registers of baptisms,
marriages, and deaths. These for the greater part were kept with
considerable scrupulosity, although there are periods during which
the same degree of care was not exercised. They are valuable
ethnologically by reason of the data which they afford with respect
to intermarriages between members of distant tribes, through the
numerous Indian personal names that they contain, and on account
of the many records of events which the priests deemed it desirable
to preserve. Examples will be given in the text of the Documentary
History to follow.</p>

<p>The <i>Libros de Fabrica</i>, in which are recorded items bearing on
the economic side of church administration, are usually less important;
still they contain data that should not be neglected, for
very often minor points deserve as much attention as salient ones.
Unfortunately the church records of the period prior to 1680 have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">p. 15</a></span>
well-nigh disappeared from New Mexico, but some still exist at El
Paso del Norte (Juarez), Chihuahua, that date back to the middle
of the seventeenth century. The absence of these records may be
somewhat overcome by another class of ecclesiastical documents,
much more numerous and more laborious to consult. In fact I am the
only one who thus far has attempted to penetrate the mass of material
which they contain, although my researches have been far from exhaustive,
owing to lack of support in my work. These documents,
commonly called "Diligencias Matrimoniales," are the results of
official investigations into the status of persons desiring to marry.
From their nature these investigations always cover a considerable
period, sometimes more than a generation, and frequently disclose
historical facts that otherwise might remain unknown. These
church papers also, though not frequently, include fragments of
correspondence and copies of edicts and decrees that deserve
attention.</p>

<p>The destruction of the archives and of writings of all kinds in
New Mexico during the Indian revolt of 1680 and in succeeding
years has left the documentary history of the province during the
seventeenth century almost a blank. Publications are very few in
number. There is no doubt that the archives of Spain and even
those of Mexico will yet reveal a number of sources as yet unknown;
but in the meantime, until these treasures are brought to light, we
must remain more or less in the dark as to the conditions and the
details of events prior to 1692. A number of letters emanating
from Franciscan sources have been published lately in Mexico by
Luis Garcia y Pimentel, and these throw sidelights on New Mexico
as it was in the seventeenth century that are not without value. In
the manuscripts from the archives at Santa F&eacute; that survived the
Pueblo revolt, now chiefly in the Library of Congress at Washington,
occasional references to events anterior to the uprising may be
found; and the church books of El Paso del Norte (Juarez) contain
some few data that should not be neglected.</p>

<p>In 1602 there was published at Rome, under the title of <i>Relaci&oacute;n
del Descubrimiento del Nuevo Mexico</i>, a small booklet by the
Dean of Santiago, Father Montoya, which purports to give a
letter from O&ntilde;ate on his occupancy of New Mexico and journey to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">p. 16</a></span>
the Colorado river of the West, thus covering the period between
1597 and 1605. It is preceded by a notice of Espejo's exploration,
but it is entirely too brief to afford much information. The little
book is exceedingly rare; but three copies of it exist in the United
States, so far as I am aware.</p>

<p>Of greater importance are the notices, of about the same period,
preserved by Fray Juan de Torquemada in the first volume of his
<i>Monarchia Indiana</i> (1615). In this work we find the first mention
of some Pueblo fetishes, with their names, as understood at the
time. The letter of Fray Francisco de San Miguel, first priest of
Pecos, given in print by Torquemada, is of considerable interest.
Torquemada himself was never in New Mexico, but he stood high
in the Franciscan Order and had full access to the correspondence
and to all other papers submitted from outside missions during his
time. It is much to be regretted that the three manuscript pamphlets
by Fray Roque Figueredo, bearing the titles <i>Relacion del Viage al
Nuevo M&eacute;xico</i>, <i>Libro de las Fundaciones del Nuevo Mexico</i>, and <i>Vidas
de los Varones Ilustres</i>, etc., appear to be lost. Their author was
first in New Mexico while O&ntilde;ate governed that province, and his
writings were at the great convent of Mexico. Whether they disappeared
during the ruthless dispersion of its archives in 1857 or
were lost at an earlier date is not known.</p>

<p>After the recall of O&ntilde;ate from New Mexico, not only the
colony but also the missions in that distant land began to decline,
owing to the bitter contentions between the political and the
ecclesiastical authorities. The Franciscan Order, desirous of inspiring
an interest in New Mexican missions, fostered the literary efforts of
its missionaries in order to promote a propaganda for conversions.
It also sent a special visitor to New Mexico in the person of
Fray Estevan de Perea, who gave expression to what he saw and
ascertained, in two brief printed but excessively rare documents, a
facsimile copy of which is owned by my friend Mr F. W. Hodge, of
the Bureau of American Ethnology. A third letter which I have
not been able to see is mentioned by Ternaux-Compans, also a
"Relacion de la Conversion de los Jumanos" by the same and
dated 1640.</p>

<p>Much more extended than the brief pamphlets by Fray Perea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">p. 17</a></span>
is the <i>Relaciones de todas las cosas acaecidas en el Nuevo Mexico
hasta el A&ntilde;o de 1626</i> (I abbreviate the very long title), by Fray
Geronimo de Z&aacute;rate Salmer&oacute;n, which was published in the third
series of the first <i>Colecci&oacute;n de Documentos para la Historia de
Mexico</i>, and also by Mr Charles F. Lummis in <i>The Land of Sunshine</i>,
with an English translation. This work, while embodying
chiefly a narrative most valuable to the ethnography of western
Arizona and eastern California, of the journey of O&ntilde;ate to the
Colorado river of the West, followed by an extended report on De
Soto's expedition to the Mississippi river, contains data on the Rio
Grande Pueblos and on those of Jemez that are of permanent value.
The author gives the numbers of Pueblo Indians officially converted
during his time.</p>

<p>We come now to a book which, though small in compass, has
had perhaps greater circulation in languages other than Spanish,
with the exception of the <i>Destruycion de las Indias</i> by the notorious
Las Casas, than any other. This is the work of Fray Alonso de
Benavides, on New Mexico, first published in 1630 under the misleading
title of <i>Memorial que Fray Juan de Santander de la Orden
de San Francisco, Comisario General de Indias, presenta a la
Magestad Catolica del Rey don Felipe cuarto nuestro Se&ntilde;or</i>, etc.,
Madrid, 1630. Benavides was custodian of the Franciscan province
of New Mexico for some time, and therefore had good opportunity
of knowing both the country and its natives. He gives a
very precise and clear enumeration of the groups of Pueblo
Indians, locating them where they had been found by Coronado
ninety years before and adding those which the latter had not
visited, as well as giving the number of villages of each group and
the approximate number of people therein contained. No writer on
New Mexico up to this time had given such a clear idea of its
ethnography, so far as the location and the distribution of the
stocks are concerned. While somewhat brief on manners and
customs, Benavides is fuller and more explicit than any of his
predecessors, and informs us of features of importance which no other
author in earlier times mentioned. In short, his book is more valuable
for New Mexican ethnography than any other thus far known,
and it is not a matter of surprise, therefore, that it was translated into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">p. 18</a></span>
several European languages. That the Rio Grande Pueblos receive
an abundant share of attention from Benavides is natural. We also
obtain from him some data, not elsewhere found, concerning the
establishment and fate of the missions, and the true relations of the
Spaniards and the natives are particularly well portrayed. Both
the Apaches and the Navajos also receive some attention, Benavides
giving, among others, the true reason for the hostility which the
Apaches displayed since that time against the Spanish settlements.
It is a book without which the study of the Pueblo Indians could
not be satisfactory.</p>

<p>Where there is strong light there must of necessity be some
shadow. In the case of Benavides the shadow is found in the exaggerated
number of inhabitants attributed to the New Mexican
Pueblos, exaggerations as gross and as glaring as those of Espejo.
The number of villages of some of the Pueblo groups is also somewhat
suspicious. It is not difficult to explain these probably intentional
deviations from the truth in an otherwise sincere and highly
valuable work. As already indicated, the publications emanating
from the Franciscan Order, which exclusively controlled the New
Mexican missions, had a special purpose distinct from that of mere
information: they were designed to promote a propaganda not simply
for the conversion of the Indians in general, but especially for
the conversions made or to be made by the Order. New Mexico was
in a state of neglect, spiritually and politically; the political
authorities had been denouncing the Franciscans in every possible way, and
there was danger, if this critical condition continued, that the Order
might lose its hold upon the northern territories and its mission be
turned over to the Jesuits, who were then successfully at work in the
Mexican northwest and approaching New Mexico from that direction.
To prevent such a loss it was deemed necessary to present to
the faithful as alluring a picture of the field as possible, exploiting
the large number of neophytes as a result already accomplished
and hinting at many more as subjects for conversion. Hence the
exaggerated number of Indians in general attributed by Benavides
to what then comprised the religious province of New Mexico. In
this respect, and in this alone, the <i>Memorial</i> of Benavides may be regarded
as a "campaign document," but this does not impair its
general value and degree of reliability.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">p. 19</a></span></p>

<p>For the period between 1630 and the uprising of 1680 there is
a lack of printed documents concerning New Mexico that is poorly
compensated by the known manuscripts which I have already mentioned
as existing in New Mexico and Mexico. Still there appeared
in 1654 a little book by Juan Diez de la Calle, entitled
<i>Memorial y Res&uacute;men breve de Noticias de las Indias Occidentales</i>, in
which the disturbances that culminated in the assassination of Governor
Luis de Rosas in 1642 are alluded to. The national archives
at the City of Mexico contain a still fuller report of that event, in a
royal decree of 1643 and other papers concerning the deed, all
of which are yet unpublished. The archives of Spain have as yet
been only meagerly investigated. The publication of the report
of Father Nicolas de Freytas, Portuguese, on the expedition
attributed to Diego de Pe&ntilde;alosa Brize&ntilde;o into what is now
Kansas or Nebraska, is of no importance in the study of the Rio
Grande Pueblos. The authenticity of the document has been
strongly doubted, though probably without just cause. Equally
unimportant to the subject of the Documentary History to follow
is the letter of Captain Juan Dominguez de Mendoza, published
in the appendix to the criticism of Cesareo Fernandez Duro on the
report of Father Freytas. The otherwise very interesting letter
on New Mexico, written by Fray Alonso de Posadas, also printed in
the work of Duro, is meager in its allusions to the Rio Grande.</p>

<p>Sixty-eight years after Benavides' time the <i>Teatro Mexicano</i> of the
Franciscan Fray Agustin de Vetancurt was published. The third
and fourth parts of this important work, namely, the <i>Cronica de la
Provincia del Santo Evangelio de Mexico</i> and the <i>Menologio Franciscano</i>,
are of the highest value to the history of the Rio Grande
Pueblos and of New Mexico generally. Although printed eighteen
years after the New Mexican missions had been destroyed by the
Pueblo Indians, the <i>Cronica</i> contains a terse description of the
missions and Indian villages as they had been previous to 1680, and
gives data in regard to the population that are commendable in their
sobriety and probability. The work of Vetancurt is in this respect
a great improvement upon Benavides, and it is interesting to note
how his approximate census approaches the figures given by Z&aacute;rate
Salmer&oacute;n seventy years before. Vetancurt had at his disposal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">p. 20</a></span>
much more precise data than Benavides. During the seven decades
separating the three authors much information had been
accumulated, and with greater chances of accuracy than before.
Vetancurt made good use of this accumulation of material, and his
books are in fact the most reliable sources from which to ascertain
the status of the Pueblos at the time the insurrection commenced.
The historical data given by Vetancurt in regard to New Mexico
during earlier times are not of great value, but the <i>Menologio</i>, as
well as the <i>Cronica</i>, contains a number of details on the missions and
on the lives and achievements of the missionaries that become important
to an understanding of the Indian himself. That such references
are overburdened with details of a purely religious character
does not at all impair their ethnologic value: they are pictures of the
times according to the nature of which circumstances and events
can alone be judged properly.</p>

<p>We have now arrived at a period marking a great temporary
change in the condition of all the Pueblo Indians, and of those of
the Rio Grande especially. This is the insurrection, successful for
a time, of the Pueblos in 1680, against the Spanish domination.
The material on this eventful epoch is still largely in manuscript,
the nearest approach to a documentary presentation in full being the
incomplete paraphrase furnished by W. W. H. Davis in his <i>Spanish
Conquest of New Mexico</i>, published in 1869. No blame should be
attached to the author for the insufficiency of his data. He made
the best possible use of his materials with the help of my late friends
David Miller and Samuel Ellison of Santa F&eacute;, but the archives of
Santa F&eacute; had already been depleted through neglect and criminal
waste, and what was and is left (as I know from having handled it
frequently and thoroughly) is a mass of fragments, sometimes long,
sometimes short, often disconnected and therefore unsatisfactory. I
shall refer to this material later. Of the manuscript materials preceding
and foreshadowing the insurrection, an important letter by
the Franciscan Fray Francisco de Ayeta, a copy of which is in the
national archives of Mexico, deserves to be specially mentioned.
To this indefatigable monk, whose timely warnings were too lightly
regarded by the Spanish authorities, are also due the data concerning
the lives and the awful fate of the Franciscan priests at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">p. 21</a></span>
hands of the Pueblo Indians on August 10, 1680. The original of
this tragic list is in manuscript in the national archives of Mexico,
where Vetancurt made use of it in his <i>Teatro</i>. The memorial
sermon preached and published in Mexico in 1681 (a copy of which
exceedingly rare print was procured by my friend the Honorable L.
Bradford Prince of Santa F&eacute;) rests for its information upon the obituaries
preserved by Father Ayeta. That these obituaries are of
direct value to the history of the Rio Grande Pueblos is apparent.</p>

<p>The sermon alluded to is the earliest print, so far as known,
concerning the great Indian uprising of 1680. Next in date comes
a publication touching the various attempts made by the Spaniards
to reconquer New Mexico prior to 1693. In that year Carlos de
Sig&uuml;enza y Gongora published in the City of Mexico a kind of
irregular newspaper bearing the title <i>El Mercurio Volante</i>, in which
appears a concise and tolerably reliable sketch of the insurrection
and the various attempts to reconquer the territory, including the
successful one in 1692 by Diego de Vargas. Sig&uuml;enza is brief,
but reasonably accurate. Part of the documents concerning the
Indian uprising were published in the nineteenth century in the
Third Series of the <i>Colecci&oacute;n de Documentos para la Historia de
Mexico</i>, but no complete print of the voluminous papers concerning
those events has yet appeared, and indeed the most important documents
still remain in manuscript. In 1701 Villagutierre y Sotomayor
published his voluminous <i>Historia de la Conquistay Reducciones
de los Itzaes y Lacandones en la America Septentrional</i>, in
which appears a brief description of the Indian uprising in New
Mexico. His data are of course gathered at second hand, although
from contemporary sources.</p>

<p>I know of no other publications concerning the Indian uprising, so
often mentioned, between the close of the seventeenth century and
the beginning of the eighteenth. The manuscript material, which has
been much scattered, may be divided locally into three groups. The
one, originally at Santa F&eacute;, New Mexico, is now in the Library of
Congress at Washington; it had been much neglected, hence for
the greater part seriously reduced, in former times, but it still contains
most valuable information on the condition of the Rio Grande
Pueblos immediately after the uprising and during the time the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">p. 22</a></span>
Pueblos were left to themselves, attempting to return to their primitive
condition. This information, embodied in interrogatories of
Indians subsequent to 1680, I made the subject of a closing chapter
to my <i>Documentary History of the Zu&ntilde;i Tribe</i>, but it was withheld
from publication for some cause unknown to me. The military
reports on the expeditions of Diego de Vargas and the final reconquest
of New Mexico are reduced to disconnected but still bulky fragments.
Almost unique of their kind are the so-called "Pueblo
grants" emanating from Governor Domingo Gironza Petros de Cruzate
in 1688. The term "grant" is a misnomer, since it refers in
fact to a limitation to the innate tendency of the Indians to arbitrarily
expand their tribal range. These documents have become the legal
basis of landholding by the Pueblos and the first step toward
eventual single tenure.</p>

<p>The second group of manuscripts, in the national archives in
the City of Mexico, is more complete than the first. It contains
information on the beginnings of the rebellion and on later events
that are of great importance.</p>

<p>The third group, and by far the most complete, is in Spain, but
in regard to it I am unable to give any precise information, since every
opportunity of completing my investigations concerning the Southwest
by studying the Spanish archives, notwithstanding repeated
promises, has been withheld.</p>

<p>For the eighteenth century documentary materials pertaining to
New Mexico remain, it may be said, almost exclusively in manuscript.
A connecting link between the printed sources of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are the <i>Apuntamientos que sobre
el Terreno hizo el Padre Jos&eacute; Amando Niel</i>, in the early part of the
eighteenth century, published in the Third Series of the <i>Documentos
para la Historia de Mexico</i>. Father Niel was a Jesuit who visited
New Mexico shortly after the reconquest. His observations are of
comparatively mediocre value, yet his writings should not be overlooked.
The journal of the Brigadier Pedro de Rivera, in 1736,
of his military march to Santa F&eacute;, is a dry, matter-of-fact account,
but is nevertheless valuable owing to his concise and utterly
unembellished description of the Rio Grande valley and of what he saw
therein. The book is very rare, and therefore correspondingly
unnoticed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">p. 23</a></span></p>

<p>A brief but important contribution to the history of New
Mexico is the letter of Fray Silvestre Velez de Escalante, published
in the Third Series of the <i>Documentos para la Historia de Mexico</i>.
About the same time, in the second half of the eighteenth century,
the Brigadier Jos&eacute; Cort&eacute;s wrote an extended report on the territory,
but it concerns more the relations with the constantly hostile roaming
tribes than the condition of the Pueblos. It also is printed in
the <i>Documentos</i>.</p>

<p>The otherwise very important diary of the journey of Fray
Francisco Garc&eacute;s to northern Arizona, published first in the above-mentioned
<i>Colecci&oacute;n de Documentos</i>, and more recently (with highly
valuable notes) by the late Dr Elliott Coues, touches only incidentally
on the Rio Grande region. In 1746 Joseph Antonio de Villa-Se&ntilde;or
y Sanchez embodied in his <i>Theatro Americano</i> a description
of New Mexico, condensed chiefly from the journal of the Brigadier
Rivera, mentioned above. The <i>Diccionario Geografico</i> by Murillo
is also a source that should not be neglected.</p>

<p>A great amount of documentary manuscript material, mostly of
a local character, is contained in the church books of the eighteenth
century formerly at the pueblo of Santa Clara and now preserved
at Santa F&eacute; through the efforts of the late Archbishop J. B. Salpointe.
There are also the "Informaciones Matrimoniales," which
contain data of great importance. Through them we are informed
of the tragic fate of the last expedition of the Spaniards to the
northwest, with its horrifying incidents. The story of woe and
disaster that pictures the life of the Indian Pueblos and Spanish
settlers during the eighteenth century is contained in fragments in
the plain, matter-of-fact church registers, and it requires painstaking
investigation to collect it. The greatest part of this information
concerns the Rio Grande Pueblos. A careful investigation of the
matrimonial and baptismal registers will yield data concerning the
clans and indications of the primitive rules of marriage, while the
"Libros de Fabrica" contain interesting data on the churches of
the Rio Grande valley. Great labor and the utmost scrutiny are
required in sifting these time-worn papers for desirable data, and
especially is a considerable knowledge of conditions and events
necessary; but the result of thorough investigation, especially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">p. 24</a></span>
through literal copying by the student, will amply repay the time
and labor bestowed.</p>

<p>What I have stated in regard to the church archives applies, in
a still greater degree, to the state and private papers that may be
accessible. Of the former the archives of Santa F&eacute; contain a great
number, though many of them are only fragmentary. Valuable
documents exist also in the archives of the Surveyor General at Santa
F&eacute;; these are valuable chiefly for historical data covering the first
half of the eighteenth century. The national archives in the City of
Mexico are much more complete than those of New Mexico, while
in Spain we may expect to find an almost complete set of government
documents, preserved with much greater care and with more
system than in any early Spanish possessions in America. The
city of Sevilla would be the first place in which research in this
direction should be conducted.</p>

<p>Before closing this bibliographic sketch with a glance at the
earliest literature of the nineteenth century, I must mention two
ponderous books of the eighteenth century which, while based on
second-hand information and not very valuable in detail, refer occasionally
to facts and data not elsewhere found. These are the two
volumes of the <i>Cr&oacute;nica Apost&oacute;lica y Ser&aacute;fica de la Propaganda Fide de
Quer&eacute;taro</i>. The first volume, written by Fray Isidro Felis Espinosa
and published in 1746, is interesting especially on account of its
reference to the fate of the first Frenchmen brought into New
Mexico, and one of whom, Juan de Archib&egrave;que, played an important
r&ocirc;le in the first two decades of the eighteenth century. The
second volume, the author of which was Fray Domingo de Arricivita,
was published in 1792, and is the chief source concerning the
still problematical expedition to the north attributed to two Franciscan
friars in 1538. Both of these works are of relatively minor
importance, and I mention them here only for the sake of completeness
and in order to warn against attaching undue importance to
them so far as the Pueblos are concerned.</p>

<p>It is of course understood that I omit from the above account a
number of publications containing more or less brief and casual
references to New Mexico. Most of them are geographical, and but
few allude to historical facts. In the notes to the Documentary
History proper I may refer to some of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">p. 25</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the last book published on New Mexico in the Spanish
language is the little book of Pino, which, however, has little more
than a bibliographic value except in so far as it touches the condition
of New Mexico at the beginning of the nineteenth century.
The documents in the New Mexican and Mexican archives up to
the date of the American occupancy present features similar to those
that characterize the Spanish documents of the eighteenth century.
It would be too tedious to refer to them in detail, and I therefore dismiss
them for the present with this brief mention. If I do not
mention here the literature on New Mexico in the English language
it is not due to carelessness or to ignorance of it, but because of its
much greater wealth in number and contents, its more ready accessibility,
and because in matters respecting the history of early times
the authors of these works have all been obliged to glean their information
from at least some of the sources that I have above
enumerated and discussed.</p>

<p>It may surprise students of New Mexican history that I have thus
far omitted the very earliest sources in print in which New Mexico
is mentioned, namely, the work of Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y
Vald&eacute;s, and that of Gomara. The former was published in part
in the first half of the sixteenth century, the entire work appearing
at Madrid not earlier than 1850 and 1851. Its title, as is well known,
is <i>Historia General y Natural de las Indias</i>. The work of Francisco
Lopez de Gomara bears the title <i>Historia de las Indias</i>, and is
in two parts. Gomara is more explicit than Oviedo, who gives
only a brief and preliminary mention; but even Gomara, while
more detailed, and basing his work evidently on the earliest data
then accessible in regard to the expedition of Coronado, cannot
be compared with the later reports of those attached to the expedition.
The value of these books is comparatively slight, so far as
New Mexico is concerned. Much more important is the <i>Historia
General</i>, etc., by Antonio de Herrera (1601-1615). What authorities
Herrera had at his command cannot be readily determined. He
may have had access to the report of Jaramillo, and he was certainly
acquainted with the letters of Coronado. Perhaps the letter of
Coronado which I have as yet been unable to find was consulted by
him. In any event Herrera's information is all second-hand, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">p. 26</a></span>
while by no means devoid of merit, his work cannot rank with
sources written by men who saw the country and took part in the
events of the earliest explorations. The map accompanying the first
volume of Herrera, while scarcely more than an outline, is still in
advance of the charts published during the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Here I may be permitted to refer to the older cartography of New
Mexico in general. Until the beginning of the seventeenth century
these maps are very defective and incomplete. It is almost as if the
Ptolemy of 1548 had served as a basis for them. Even the large
and beautiful globe constructed at St. Gall in Switzerland in 1595,
and now in the Swiss National Museum at Z&uuml;rich, places Tiguex
near the Pacific coast. It is through the work of Benavides that
more correct ideas of New Mexican geography were gained and a
somewhat more accurate and detailed nomenclature was introduced,
since the <i>Geografie Blaviane</i> of 1667 by the Dutch cartographer
Jean Blaeuw contains a map of the region far superior to any hitherto
published. The number of early maps of New Mexico is larger
than is generally supposed, and there are to-day unpublished maps
(for instance in the National Archives of Mexico for the eighteenth
century) that indicate, as existing, Indian pueblos and missions that
were abandoned nearly a century before the maps were made.</p>

<p>I must state that in this Introduction I have abbreviated as much
as practicable the titles of books and manuscripts. These are often
very long, and it is unnecessary to burden the present text with
them, as I shall have to give the full titles in the notes to the Documentary
History proper.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place to add to the above a brief review
of the distribution and location of the various Pueblo groups at the
beginning of the sixteenth century, but strictly according to documentary
information alone. The location of different villages
must be reserved for later treatment, hence as the ranges of the
various linguistic groups had no definite boundaries, only the relative
position and approximate extent can be given here.</p>

<p>Following the course of the Rio Grande to the north from
northern Chihuahua, the Mansos were first met, in the vicinity of the
present Juarez, Mexico. This was in 1598. Nearly one hundred
and forty years later Brigadier Don Pedro de Rivera met them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">p. 27</a></span>
farther north, not far from Las Cruces and Do&ntilde;a Ana, New Mexico.
To-day they are again at El Paso del Norte. About San Marcial
on the Rio Grande began the villages of the Piros, at present reduced
to one small village on the right bank of the Rio Grande
below El Paso. The Piros extended in the sixteenth century as far
north in the Rio Grande valley as Alamillo at least, and a branch of
them had established themselves on the borders of the great eastern
plains of New Mexico, southeast of the Manzano. That branch,
which has left well-known ruins at Ab&oacute;, Gran Quivira (Tabir&aacute;), and
other sites in the vicinity, abandoned its home in the seventeenth century,
forming the Piro settlement below El Paso, already mentioned.
North of the Piros, between a line drawn south of Isleta and the
Mesa del Canjelon, the Tiguas occupied a number of villages,
mostly on the western bank of the river, and a few Tigua settlements
existed also on the margin of the eastern plains beyond the
Sierra del Manzano. These outlying Tigua settlements also were
abandoned in the seventeenth century, their inhabitants fleeing from
the Apaches and retiring to form the Pueblo of Isleta del Sur on
the left bank of the Rio Grande in Texas.</p>

<p>North of the Tiguas the Queres had their homes on both sides
of the river as far as the great ca&ntilde;on south of San Ildefonso, and
an outlying pueblo of the Queres, isolated and quite remote to the
west, was Acoma. The most northerly villages on the Rio Grande
were those of the Tehuas. Still beyond, but some distance east of
the Rio Grande, lay the Pueblos of Taos and Picuris, the inhabitants
of which spoke a dialectic variation of the Tigua language
of the south. The Tehuas also approached the Rio Grande quite
near, at what is called La Bajada; and in about the same latitude,
including the former village at Santa F&eacute;, began that branch of the
Tehuas known as Tanos, whose settlements ranged from north of
Santa F&eacute; as far as the eastern plains and southward to Tajique,
where their territory bordered that of the eastern Tiguas.</p>

<p>The Rio Grande Queres extended also as far west as the Jemez
river; and north of them, on the same stream, another linguistic
group, the Jemez, had established themselves and built several villages
of considerable size. East of the Rio Grande and southwest-ward
from Santa F&eacute; another branch of the Jemez occupied the
northern valley of the Rio Pecos.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">p. 28</a></span></p>

<p>The main interest in this distribution of the Rio Grande Pueblos
lies in the fact that it establishes a disruption and division of some
of these groups prior to the sixteenth century, but of the cause and
the manner thereof there is as yet no documentary information.
Thus the Tigua Indians of Taos and Picuris are separated from their
southern relatives on the Rio Grande by two distinct linguistic groups,
the Tehuas and the Queres; the Jemez and the Pecos were divided
from each other by the Queres and the Tanos. That the Piros and
the Tiguas should have separated from the main stock might be
accounted for by the attraction of the great salt deposits about the
Manzano and greater accessibility to the buffalo plains, but that in the
Rio Grande valley itself foreign linguistic groups should have interposed
themselves between the northern and southern Tiguas and the
Jemez and Pecos constitutes a problem which only diligent research
in traditions, legends, and the native languages may satisfactorily
solve.</p>
